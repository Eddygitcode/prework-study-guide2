# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to kickoff the coding bootcamp course.  I built this project to get introduced to HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  It taught me how the languages of a webpage fit together and how they each have their own syntax.

## Usage

When looking at the webpage, you can right click and "Inspect" the page and then go to "Console" to see the javascript at work.  On the page itself, you can see notes about the different topics we covered including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git.
